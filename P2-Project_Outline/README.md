# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Pair-a-Peer is a simple to use website that pairs local community college students with their peer mentors that are similar in demographics. I am a current student at Longview Community College, and my peer mentors were either outside of my age range and not my peer, or I didn't even know I had peer mentors. This website allows students to take the reins themselves, if they need help. 
A student will go to the page to begin. They will type in their name, age, degree program, and what level of education they are in, and click submit. The program will determine their closest peer mentor based on the information submitted, and give the student the contact information of their peer mentor. 
### Features
This program has only one feature. It is a simple program that takes in data from the user and submits it to a program that sorts their information.
### Technologies
Javascript
HTML
CSS
### What I'll Have to Learn
I specifically chose this project to be well within my current understanding of these programs.
### Project Tracker
I have no idea how to do that. I barely understand what Trello is.
